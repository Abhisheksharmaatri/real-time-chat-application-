#Real-time Chat Application with WebSockets

Description:
Build a real-time chat application using Node.js, Express.js, and WebSockets. The application should allow users to create accounts, log in, and join chat rooms where they can exchange messages with other users in real time. Implement features like online/offline status, typing indicators, and message notifications. You can use the Socket.IO library for WebSocket communication.

Features:
User registration and authentication: Allow users to sign up, log in, and manage their profiles.
Chat room creation and joining: Users should be able to create new chat rooms or join existing ones.
Real-time messaging: Enable users to send and receive messages instantly within the chat rooms.
Online/offline status: Show users' online/offline status in the chat interface.
Typing indicators: Display typing indicators when a user is actively typing a message.
Message notifications: Notify users of new messages, even if they are not currently active in the chat room.
File attachments: Allow users to upload and share files within the chat rooms.
User search: Implement a search functionality to find other users and start private conversations.

Benefits:
This project will help you deepen your understanding of WebSocket communication and real-time applications.
You'll gain experience in handling user authentication and managing user sessions.
You'll work with dynamic content, templating engines, and a database for storing user information and messages.
By implementing various features, you'll strengthen your skills in error handling, validation, and asynchronous programming.
Remember to break the project down into smaller tasks, plan your architecture, and leverage your knowledge of the MVC pattern to organize your code effectively. Additionally, consider using a database like MongoDB or Sequelize for storing chat messages and user information.

Good luck with your project!
